Figure \\ref{fig:Column} provides interesting information about resources and activities handled by them. Mary does much more than any other employee. We can see that six resources have almost the same amount of work. Julie has the least amount of work (according to provided data).\n",

    "In chart \\\\ref{fig:Register} we see that Mary is handles registration most often. Chart \\ref{fig:Send Answer} shows that resource are similar responsibility in the matter of sending answers. Figure \\ref{fig:Follow} shows that “Follow up” is Eric's domain. Jane is focused on three tasks, but also sometimes does “frontline resolution”. Whereas Liam spends his time on “investigate” and “register”. Histogram Chart component \\ref{fig:Histogram} shows that the first three weeks are the most intense period of work. Then we see a decline, the next seven weeks are a rather peaceful period of work.\n",
