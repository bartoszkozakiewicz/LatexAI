LatexAI is powered by Google's PaLM and is focusing on helping the writing process of technical and scientific articles. During ideation we have identified 3 core functionalities that could help our users boost both effectiveness and efficiency of their work. Those functionalities are:
1. Autocompletion working both for natural language (text) and LaTeX syntax.
2. Suggestions for citations and assistance in creating a bibliography.
3. Conducting a comprehensive review of the paper. We believe that by providing and improving those 3 functionalities we can provide a lot of value to our users.
